### Hey 👋 I'm Kim, web dev at [🖍️](https://github.com/puzzlepart) (formerly Puzzlepart)

I work mostly with SPFx, Azure, Node, and Typescript, as well as old-school onprem stuff. I live and work mostly from home outside Oslo with my wife kids and cats. When I'm not working I waste time on selfhosting, microcontrollers, and LoRas, both in the [Radio](https://github.com/HelTecAutomation/Heltec_ESP32) and [LLM](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/training/lora) sense.
