### Hey 👋 I'm Kim - I solve problems using computers

I work mostly in the M365 ecosystem (SPFx, graph, azure etc), as well as some old school on-prem stuff.  
I'm an Oslo suburb coastal native, living with my wife kids and cats.  
When not working I spend my time bouldering, alpine skiing, volunteering with the norwegian red cross SAR corps,  
writing [silly CLIs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/badevann), [selfhosting](https://damsleth.no), microcontrollers and LoRas (both in the [Radio](https://github.com/HelTecAutomation/Heltec_ESP32) and [LLM](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/training/lora) sense).
