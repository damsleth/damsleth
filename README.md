### Hey 👋 I'm Kim, consultant at [🖍️](https://github.com/puzzlepart)Crayon Consulting

I work mostly in the M365 ecosystem (spfx, graph, azure etc) as well as some old school on-prem stuff. I'm an Oslo suburb coastal native, living with my wife kids and cats. When not working I spend my time bouldering, alpine skiing, writing CLIs, selfhosting, microcontrollers and LoRas (both in the [Radio](https://github.com/HelTecAutomation/Heltec_ESP32) and [LLM](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/training/lora) sense).
